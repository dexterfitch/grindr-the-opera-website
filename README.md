##'GRINDR: The Opera' Website
by Dex Fitch

A one-page website to promote the musical production "GRINDR The Opera" by Erik Ransom. Design inspiration was drawn from the app Grindr itself, Broadway billboards, and pixel art.


##'GRINDR: The Opera' Synopsis
"GRINDR The Opera" is an original, operatic parody which explores contemporary themes within the gay community through a comically melodramatic lens with musical homages to operatic titans, like Mozart and Puccini, as well as thematic nods to more recent musical influences like The Village People and Lady Gaga.


##Motivation

I've worked with Erik before on another production of his, "Coming the Musical" (http://www.comingthemusical.com), and was delighted to be commissioned by him again. I wanted to try a bootstrap-based site this time, and to dip a toe in the realm of pixel art for the design.
